#Loops in Python are control flow structures that allow code to be executed repeatedly. 
Python supports two main types of loops: for loops and while loops. 

Python does not have a built-in do-while loop like some other programming languages.

# Jump statements
"""
Jump statements in Python are control flow tools that alter the sequential execution of code. They transfer control to another part of the program. Python has three main jump statements: break, continue, and return.

1. break: This statement terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.

2. continue: It skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
3. return: This statement exits the current function and optionally returns a value to the caller.

#For Loops
"""
A for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable object. 

for iterates n times, where n is number of elements in a sequence.

while loop is used to conditionally repeat a block of code.

Syntax:
for variable in iterable-sequence:
