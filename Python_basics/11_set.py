# Introduction:
"""
üí°Different from other iterable present in python.

‚û§ A set is a class and a built-in data type in python.
‚ú¶ Sets are mutable, meaning elements can be added or removed, but the elements themselves must be immutable. 

‚ùñ A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. (Set is not a sequence, we never know the order in which the elements are stored inside the set.)
‚ú¶Ô∏é Set does not guarantee to store values in the order of insertion. 


‚óâ Indexing is not applicable to set objects so, slicing operator is not applicable. 
‚ú¶Ô∏é Set is iterable.

‚Üí Sets are defined using curly braces {} or the set() constructor.

# ‚ùå Python sets do not automatically sort elements. ‚úÖ The order you see is based on internal hash mechanisms, not sorting.
